I currently have 2 ideas for an app. A better Formula 1 app and a Animal Shelter app for my local animal shelter.

**Formula 1 App**

The idea I have for a better formula 1 app, is an app that goes more in-depth into stats. Similar to the Fotmob app, but for formula 1. Some of
the features I would like to add is driver ratings and in depth historical stats. 

**Animal Shelter App**

This will be an app that would help users adopt pets. Making it a great user expereince.
A feature I would like to add is personal matching and detailed profiles.
